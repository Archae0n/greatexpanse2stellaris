Persistent acid rainstorms and highly alkaline soil make this world lethal to all known higher forms of life.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place.

This type of planet cannot sustain organic life.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. Surface temperatures are lower than normally expected for this type of world. The volcanic eruptions are less frequent, but the sheer heat and lack of atmosphere means the planet cannot sustain life."
 pc_molten_cold3:0 "Scorching World"

Somewhat low temperatures and a semi thin atmosphere, coupled with powerful blizzards, precludes the existence of life on the surface.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. Localised pollution has increased the temperature of several regions dramatically. However, a side effect of the forming atmosphere has revealed itself - huge gale-force winds packing bitterly cold winds and ice shards broken from the melted regions. It remains impossible for surface life to survive."
 pc_frozen_heat4:0 "Blizzard World"
 pc_frozen_heat4_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a layer of frozen ice. Low temperatures and a semi thin atmosphere, coupled with powerful blizzards, precludes the existence of complex life on the surface.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. The ice has begun to melt in several regions, creating slushy rivers and lakes on the surface. Meanwhile, the planet's core has heated up in response to our atmospheric efforts, further pushing the thaw and the temperature. The windstorms remain a serious threat to existence on the surface."
 pc_frozen_heat5:0 "Glacial World"
 pc_frozen_heat5_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a layer of frozen ice, with some glaciers dotted in the oceans. A somewhat stable atmosphere, coupled with powerful blizzards, precludes the existence of complex life on the surface.\n\nIt appears that an attempt at terraforming this world has taken place. Large glaciers have broken off the main landscape of the planets and drift across the ocean. The severity of the blizzards has also calmed, and efforts can now be directed to stabilising both the atmosphere and the planet's new temperature."
