 masterclearance.1.name:0 "Plans for a Subterranean Complex on [Root.Planet.GetName]"
 masterclearance.1.desc:0 "Our grand excavation project is underway! While some residents may complain of local tremors and ground displacement, the occasional collapsed city block is a small price to pay for progress. Now, what should our subterranean city become? \n\nOur Generals have proposed a nearly impenetrable underground fortress with enough food and capacity to shelter the more important members of society should our world ever suffer from orbital bombardment. However our head of engineering has proposed a radical geothermal foundry that could revolutionize planetary production methods. \n\nA few fringe environmental groups have raised objections to this idea on the grounds that upsetting planetary tectonics might have unforeseen consequences, while local representatives of the artisan troupe have petitioned that the sulfur fumes of the forges would ruin their olfactory artwork. However, these naysayers are of little importance, so what shall we build?"
 masterclearance.fortress.name:0 "Open an underground Fortress"
 masterclearance.fortress.tooltip:0 "Defense is the best defense. \n\n§Y$ON_COMPLETION$:§! \n§G-20%§! $MOD_PLANET_ORBITAL_BOMBARDMENT_DAMAGE$ \n§G+50%§! $MOD_ARMY_DAMAGE_MULT$"

 masterclearance.2.name:0 "Subterranean Fortress Complete, [Root.Planet.GetName] Secured"
 masterclearance.2.desc:0 "Our grand excavation project is complete. It marks a new era for [Root.Planet.GetName], thousands of our citizens can now live out their entire lives and never see the sun. Some should probably still go outside, but the important point is they no longer have to.\n\nLocal military commanders boast that the fortress blast doors could withstand a direct gigacannon impact. They have quieted down after our Fleet Admiral offered to personally test this theory, but there is little doubt that should any ordinance breach our atmosphere, the safest place to be is underground."
 masterclearance.fortress2.name:0 "Open the blast doors"

 masterclearance.3.name:0 "Subterranean Foundry Makes [Root.Planet.GetName] Great Again"
 masterclearance.3.desc:0 "Our grand excavation project is complete. The magma forges are running at full capacity, and fleet command is eagerly ordering up a new line of forge-formed cruisers, expecting local shipyards to be unable to keep pace with the new influx of minerals. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the local artisan troupe has mobilized a full olfactory protest near the foundry entrance, wearing what appear to be gas masks in solidarity. However, the latest newsletter spoke of "artisanal protesting" as their next big project, so it is hard to take such antics seriously. Engineering reports that Foundry integrity is within expected parameters, and residents are almost certainly safe."

 masterclearance.sky.desc:0 "While we set off for the stars long ago, the last corner of untouched living space on [Root.Planet.GetName] lies between the cluttered ground and the great void. Today our scientists say we can inhabit the place our ancestors believed was home the gods. \n\nThere are many dreams for what this cloud city could be. Merchants, traders and corporate representatives have proposed a Sky Mall, described as an incredibly lucrative venture. Members of the Faction for a Better Tomorrow, a local activist group have released plans for a floating greenspace, an idealistic paradise accessible to all citizens. Last, a group of extraordinarily wealthy individuals that style themselves as the glorious 1% propose a series of personal estates that will isolate them from the grubby masses. They pledge increased support the government, yet such an elitist action would doubtless lead to social strife. What shall we build?"

 masterclearance.skyestatebuilt.desc:0 "With the completion of the new cloud estate, the local elite have vowed never to set foot on [Root.Planet.GetName] again. Local authorities have relatively little sway with these cloud dwellers, and they are sure to do all that is in their considerable wealth and power to keep their high position. Some even threatenly proclaim that it is in our empire's best interests are to keep them happy, whatever that means. Down below, the rabble complain how this perfectly symbolizes the inherent inequality of the syst- but honestly, you cannot hear them from up here."

 #Patchnotes

 #New Event chain for Foundries. Will trigger for previously built foundries. The chain is a nerf, but only a brutal one if you let it. Or if you are incredibly unlucky. This is Fine.
 #AI slightly less afraid of building Foundries. AI will not get foundry event chain on the off chance they do build a foundry, because they cannot be trusted
 #Open an Underground Fortress tooltip now properly displays +50% Defense Army Damage, not +50% Army Damage. This has always been the effect, but now the tooltip isnt a liar
