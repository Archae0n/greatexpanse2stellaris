  MediumDreadnought.1.name:0 "Choose your hull"
  MediumDreadnought.1.desc:0 "In order to make this mod as flexible as possible, this event has been put in. Below is a list of all the current possible Drreadnought GFX to choose from. There are 3 weapon styles to choose from, and currently 2 GFX to choose from. As more GFX is obtained, or more weapon loadouts, more options will be added. If there is a specific GFX, or weapon loadout you want, come comment on our mod page."
