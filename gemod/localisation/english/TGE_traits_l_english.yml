 trait_saxheelian:0 "Saxheelian"
 trait_saxheelian_desc:0 "§LA collective of species from the Triangulum and now Andromeda galaxies, the Saxheelians as a whole are biological masters. They use advanced organic technology in all facets of their day to day lives and long ago achieved the perfection of biological immortality. With vastly increased intelligence, physical strength, and other notable abilities, all species who call themselves Saxheelians are nothing short of remarkable. However, this has had downsides; Haleelians, the most numerous, are massive creatures and require an extremely long time to grow. Others require intensely specific environments, or decades of childhood before they are valuable members of society. This complexity is expressed in an increased need for food, a reduced overall speed of population growth, and a large reduction of general habitability. In exchange, the Saxheelians gain an increased average lifespan and an increase in society output to represent their biological affinity. §!\n"

 trait_broman:0 "Broman"
 trait_broman_desc:0 "Broman species are descendant from Archelon turtles that were brought to their now homeworld as part of a project to seed life. Broman's themselves being large turtles do have the capacity to live long lives. There is a whole segment on war based on insufficient land and scientific hunger as well, but bromans by nature have always been slow and cumbersome who seek peace more often than they do conflict (I have taken Pacifist and Materialist). My bios goes on to say how they have never fought an interstellar species and as such their war tactics are based around their own lackings. Thus they make terrible warriors.\n\nby EarthyTurtle"
