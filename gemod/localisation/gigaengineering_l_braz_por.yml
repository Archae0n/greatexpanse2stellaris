 gigablackhole.1000.desc:0 "With the mirror frame now finished around [FromFrom.GetName], we now have to make a choice.

Everything in the system will be destroyed, and the explosion will be so powerful it propagates through hyperlanes. Every planet in neighboring systems will be rendered uninhabitable from the flow of energy, and every planet two jumps away will be irradiated. Most importantly, it will send a shockwave through subspace, disturbing and rearranging hyperlanes from up to 4 jumps away!"

Millenia ago, three major superpowers pooled their knowledge to try and develop an experimental device capable of seeding life onto any rocky planet, no matter how hostile or desolate. And, by all accounts, they succeeded, as shown by the current state of the Withdrawal system.\n\nThe final goal of this project was to create a perfect haven for everyone to live in, and so these superpowers preparing the system for future habitation. It appears that the automated robotic units tasked with setting up infrastructure on the planet encountered no issues, but a few years after sapient life settled on the planets, all hell broke loose. The planets' ecosystems were resilient. Incredibly resilient. So resilient in fact, that fauna and flora began attacking the unsuspecting colonists, collapsing buildings and swallowing cities. It seems that the "Staff of Life" was too efficient, rendering the planets uninhabitable to sapient life. Unfortunately, the project exhausted the superpowers' economy, as they had not anticipated a failure, causing their decline and eventual collapse.\n\nEach superpower seems to have contributed to about one third of this "Staff of Life". Our scientists believe that if we can somehow manage to locate these empires' home systems, we might be able to reconstitute the "Staff of Life" for ourselves."
