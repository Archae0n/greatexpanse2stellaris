However, it is not what we want, and we have tried to annul the Covenant many times over.\n\nWe could not.\n\nWhat we are plundered is everything. In an instant, so fast there is no time to react, let alone respond, the [Root.GetName] is... gone. Where once there was thriving colonies, there is now only death. Where once mighty fleets crossed the void, there is only ghosts and debris. Worse, other empires think we have formed the Covenant with our free will because of the immense power given us. All devoured by the End.\n\n"

Made immensely powerful by the devoured consciousnesses of our nations, it now roams the galaxy seeking further prey."
